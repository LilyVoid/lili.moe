            <h1>About me</h1>
			<p>
                I'm Lily. I have many interests—among them: software,
                hardware, general science, language learning,
                human biology, gaming, and whatever random topic steals my attention for the day.

            </p>
            <p>
                I program random things in Rust, and I have recently been getting into web development as well. I'm currently
                learning astro and plain JS.
            </p>
            <p>
                I plan on buying a drawing tablet later, as art has been on my mind for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been dealing with crippling depression since the age of 11
                (which has gotten a lot better)—so you won't see me being very
                talkative/social—I have been deprived of socialization from a young age, and my autism diagnosis doesn't help.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of the things I know are self-taught via the internet.
            </p>
            <p> If you struggle with emotional control—trauma-dumping, outbursts, mood swings, or
                acting toxic for no reason,
                please never speak with me—and consider getting the help that you need.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, I use the em dash—no, I'm not an LLM.
